=== Description

The Opacity Micromap extension `VK_EXT_opacity_micromap` supports the new
pipeline creation flag
`VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_RAY_TRACING_OPACITY_MICROMAP_BIT_EXT`, indicating that
the ray tracing pipeline may be used with acceleration structures
referencing micromaps.
This allows for possible optimizations, knowing beforehand that opacity
micromaps may be used with the pipeline.

An equivalent flag does not exist for pipelines supporting Ray Query with
opacity micromaps, such as graphics and compute.
Consequently, it is currently not possible to optimize such pipelines for
no-opacity, e.g. when opacity micromaps are supported by an application but
not used by the pipeline.
This may lead to performance degradation.

This extension adds a new flag,
`VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_2_DISALLOW_OPACITY_MICROMAP_BIT_ARM`, indicating that a
pipeline will NOT be used with an acceleration structure referencing an
opacity micromap, therefore allowing possible pipeline optimizations.
