=== Description

Ray tracing can very efficiently render from geometry which has very fine
detail, but when using only a basic triangle representation, memory
consumption can be an issue.
This extension adds the ability to add a _displacement map_ to add more
detail to triangles in an acceleration structure with an efficient in-memory
format.
The format is externally visible to allow the application to compress its
internal geometry representations into the compressed format ahead of time.
This format adds displacements along a defined vector to subtriangle
vertices which are subdivided from the main triangles.

This extension provides:

  * a new elink:VkMicromapTypeEXT format for the displacement micromap,
  * a structure to extend
    slink:VkAccelerationStructureGeometryTrianglesDataKHR to attach a
    displacement micromap to the geometry of the acceleration structure,
  * enums extending elink:VkBuildAccelerationStructureFlagBitsKHR to allow
    for updates.

=== Issues

(1) What is the status of this extension?
--
  * Deprecated.
    The VK_NV_cluster_acceleration_structure extension is not a one-to-one
    replacement for this extension but enables similar performance
    improvements for high-tessellation geometry and is considered the
    preferred direction to improve high-tessellation geometry performance.
