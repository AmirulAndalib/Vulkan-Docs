=== Description

apiext:VK_KHR_maintenance8 adds a collection of minor features, none of
which would warrant an entire extension of their own.

The new features are as follows:

  * Allow copies between depth/stencil and "`matching`" color attachments
  * Allow `dstCache` in `vkMergePipelineCaches` to be implicitly
    synchronized.
  * Require src/dst sync scopes to work when doing queue family ownership
    transfers
  * Support `Offset` (as an alternative to `ConstOffset`) image operand in
    texture sampling and fetch operations
  * Use the SPIR-V definition of code:OpSRem and code:OpSMod, making these
    operations produce well-defined results for negative operands
  * Loosen layer restrictions when blitting from 3D images to other image
    types
  * Add space for an additional 64 access flags for use with
    VkMemoryBarrier2, VkBufferMemoryBarrier2, and VkImageMemoryBarrier2
