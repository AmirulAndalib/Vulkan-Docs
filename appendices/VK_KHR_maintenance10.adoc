=== Description

apiext:VK_KHR_maintenance10 adds a collection of minor features, none of
which would warrant an entire extension of their own.

The new features are as follows:

  * New image format feature bits that indicate support for copying depth or
    stencil aspects using non-graphics queue families
  * If flink:vkCmdSetSampleMaskEXT is called with pname:pSampleMask set to
    `NULL`, it is treated as if the mask has all bits set to `1`.
  * Add vkCmdEndRendering2KHR as an extensible version of vkCmdEndRendering
  * Add input attachment information to dynamic rendering
  * Require that vertex inputs follow sRGB encoding when those formats are
    used, instead of being underspecified.
  * Add a query to determine if sRGB images are resolved in nonlinear or
    linear space by default
  * Add an optional feature to allow applications to override the default
    sRGB resolve behavior
  * Add resolve mode and depth-stencil resolve support to
    `vkCmdResolveImage2` to bring it in-line with render pass attachment
    resolves
