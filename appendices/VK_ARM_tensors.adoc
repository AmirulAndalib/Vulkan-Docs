=== Description

This extension adds support for tensors.

include::{generated}/interfaces/VK_ARM_tensors.adoc[]

=== New SPIR-V Capabilities

  * <<spirvenv-capabilities-table-TensorsARM, code:TensorsARM>>
  * <<spirvenv-capabilities-table-StorageTensorArrayDynamicIndexingARM,
    code:StorageTensorArrayDynamicIndexingARM>>
  * <<spirvenv-capabilities-table-StorageTensorArrayNonUniformIndexingARM,
    code:StorageTensorArrayNonUniformIndexingARM>>

=== Issues

1) Should tensor strides be passed in elements or in bytes?

*RESOLVED*: Strides are passed in bytes but are required to be a multiple of
the tensor element size.
Passing strides in bytes makes it possible to relax this requirement in the
future without an interface change.
It also makes it easier to describe memory alignment requirements.

2) Should there be commands to copy data between tensors and buffers/images?

*RESOLVED*: Adding these commands would result in a rather large API surface
and not insignificant implementation and validation cost.
The same outcome can be achieved with memory aliasing and tensor to tensor
copy operations.

3) Should this extension define transpose and/or other data reorganization
operations?

*RESOLVED*: These operations are useful to expose but this extension is only
meant to add base support for tensors.
Additional operations should be layered on top and defined in other
extensions.

4) Why are tensor strides described using signed integers?

*RESOLVED*: Negative strides make it possible to describe different linear
data layouts.
While this extension does not allow negative strides, it uses signed
integers for strides to make it possible to relax this limitation in future
extensions.
