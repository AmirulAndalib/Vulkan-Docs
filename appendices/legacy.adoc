= Legacy and Superseded Functionality

Functionality in the specification such as commands and structures may: be
marked as _legacy_.
This label indicates that either functionality that supersedes it is
available in a newer core version, or the functionality has simply fallen
out of favor for other reasons.
Forward-looking applications should: avoid using functionality marked as
legacy where possible.

A link to an explanatory section is provided to explain why the
functionality was marked as legacy, what functionality supersedes it (if
any), and what applications should: do instead.

Newer extensions may: also provide functionality that supersedes existing
functionality, but the original functionality will not be tagged as legacy
in the specification unless a superseding solution has been fully promoted
to the core API.
Explanatory text will still be included below for these cases as reference.

[NOTE]
====
Legacy and superseded functionality is tagged in the xml registry via a
deprecation tag, for both core versions and extensions.
It is expected that tooling such as the validation layers will be able to
warn users when they are making use of any functionality that is either
legacy or superseded by the version and extensions the application has
enabled.
====

Legacy functionality remains available for use in the specification, but it
may: be less capable than newer functionality.
Interactions with legacy functionality will often be omitted when new
extensions or features are developed, so legacy functionality may: not work
with the latest features.

[NOTE]
====
Another mechanism exists to indicate that an entire extension is considered
legacy, using different terminology.
See <<extendingvulkan-compatibility-deprecation, the Deprecation section of
the Extensions chapter>> for more information.

== List of Legacy Functionality

When functionality is marked as legacy or if an extension supersedes it, an
explanation will be added to the following sections.

ifdef::VKSC_VERSION_1_0[]
This section is currently empty for Vulkan SC.
endif::VKSC_VERSION_1_0[]
ifndef::VKSC_VERSION_1_0[]
[NOTE]
====
This list is a work in progress - we intend to add other items to this
section over time.
Examples include shader modules (superseded by apiext:VK_KHR_maintenance5)
and anything superseded by a new version of the same functionality (e.g.
apiext:VK_KHR_synchronization2).
====

ifdef::VK_BASE_VERSION_1_1[]
[[legacy-gpdp2]]
=== Physical Device Queries: Superseded via version 2

apiext:VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2 was incorporated into Vulkan
1.1, which introduced new versions of several physical device query
functions.
These provide the same functionality as the Vulkan 1.0 functionality but
with greater extensibility.

When querying device features, flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2 should: be
used instead of flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures.
When enabling device features, slink:VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2 should: be
provided in the pname:pNext chain of slink:VkDeviceCreateInfo instead of
using slink:VkDeviceCreateInfo::pEnabledFeatures.
endif::VK_BASE_VERSION_1_1[]

[[legacy-version-macros]]
=== Version Macros: Superseded via replacements including API variant

The version macros that do not take the API variant into account, such as
dlink:VK_MAKE_VERSION or dlink:VK_VERSION_MAJOR, are superseded by those
that do, such as dlink:VK_MAKE_API_VERSION or dlink:VK_API_VERSION_MAJOR.

Instead of dlink:VK_API_VERSION, specific version defines (e.g.
dlink:VK_API_VERSION_1_0) or the dlink:VK_MAKE_API_VERSION macro should be
used instead.

[[legacy-devicelayers]]
=== Device Layers: Superseded via instance layers

Previous versions of this specification distinguished between instance and
device layers.
Instance layers were only able to intercept commands that operate on
sname:VkInstance and sname:VkPhysicalDevice, except they were not able to
intercept flink:vkCreateDevice.
Device layers were enabled for individual devices when they were created,
and could only intercept commands operating on that device or its child
objects.

Device-only layers are now marked as legacy, and this specification no
longer distinguishes between instance and device layers.
Layers are enabled during instance creation, and are able to intercept all
commands operating on that instance or any of its child objects.
At the time this was marked as legacy, there were no known device-only
layers and no compelling reason to create one.

ifdef::VK_GRAPHICS_VERSION_1_2,VK_KHR_create_renderpass2[]
[[legacy-renderpass2]]
=== Render Pass Functions: Superseded via version 2

ifdef::VK_KHR_create_renderpass2[apiext:VK_KHR_create_renderpass2]
ifdef::VK_GRAPHICS_VERSION_1_2+VK_KHR_create_renderpass2[and]
ifdef::VK_GRAPHICS_VERSION_1_2[Vulkan 1.2]
introduced new versions of several render pass functions.
These provide the same functionality as the Vulkan 1.0 functionality but
with greater extensibility.

ifdef::VK_GRAPHICS_VERSION_1_4,VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering_local_read[]
[NOTE]
====
Render pass objects and all related commands are further
<<legacy-dynamicrendering, superseded by dynamic rendering>>.
====
endif::VK_GRAPHICS_VERSION_1_4,VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering_local_read[]
endif::VK_GRAPHICS_VERSION_1_2,VK_KHR_create_renderpass2[]

ifdef::VK_GRAPHICS_VERSION_1_4,VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering_local_read[]
=== [[legacy-dynamicrendering]]Render Pass Objects: Superseded via dynamic rendering

ifdef::VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering[apiext:VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering]
ifdef::VK_GRAPHICS_VERSION_1_3+VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering[and]
ifdef::VK_GRAPHICS_VERSION_1_3[Vulkan 1.3]
added a new way to specify render passes without needing to create
slink:VkFramebuffer and slink:VkRenderPass objects.
However, subpass functionality had no equivalent, meaning dynamic rendering
was only suitable as a substitute for content not using subpasses.

ifdef::VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering_local_read[apiext:VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering_local_read]
ifdef::VK_GRAPHICS_VERSION_1_4+VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering_local_read[and]
ifdef::VK_GRAPHICS_VERSION_1_4[Vulkan 1.4]
later allowed the expression of most subpass functionality in core or
extensions.
Any subpass functionality which was not replicated is still expressible but
requires applications to split work over multiple dynamic render pass
instances.
Functionality not covered with local reads would result in most or all
vendors splitting the subpass internally.

ifdef::VK_QCOM_render_pass_shader_resolve[]
[NOTE]
====
apiext:VK_QCOM_render_pass_shader_resolve does not have equivalent
functionality exposed via dynamic rendering.
Use of legacy functionality will be required to use that extension
unless/until replacements are created.
====
endif::VK_QCOM_render_pass_shader_resolve[]

Outside of vendor extensions, applications are advised to make use of
flink:vkCmdBeginRendering and flink:vkCmdEndRendering to manage render
passes from this API version onward.
endif::VK_GRAPHICS_VERSION_1_4,VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering_local_read[]
endif::VKSC_VERSION_1_0[]
