ifdef::VK_EXT_swapchain_maintenance1[]
The application can: provide a fence that the implementation
endif::VK_EXT_swapchain_maintenance1[]
ifndef::VK_EXT_swapchain_maintenance1[]
Regarding interaction with flink:vkQueueWaitIdle, fname:vkQueuePresentKHR
behaves as if it signals a fence payload that is managed by the
implementation and that has no associated slink:VkFence handle.
The fence
endif::VK_EXT_swapchain_maintenance1[]
will signal after all such queue operations have completed, and after the
presentation engine has taken a reference to the payloads of all objects
ifdef::VK_EXT_swapchain_maintenance1[]
provided in sname:VkPresentInfoKHR
endif::VK_EXT_swapchain_maintenance1[]
that the presentation engine accesses as part of the present operation.
The fence may: not wait for the present operation to complete.
ifdef::VK_EXT_swapchain_maintenance1[]
For all
ifdef::VK_KHR_timeline_semaphore[binary]
wait semaphores imported by the presentation engine using the equivalent of
reference transference, as described in
<<synchronization-semaphores-importing,Importing Semaphore Payloads>>, this
fence must: not signal until all such semaphore payloads have been reset by
the presentation engine.
