[open,refpage='VkExternalComputeQueueNV',desc='Opaque handle to an external compute queue',type='handles']
--
External compute queues are used to join compatible external APIs to a
sname:VkDevice, allowing workloads submitted through these external APIs to
be executed simultaneously to workloads submitted through Vulkan.

External compute queues are represented by sname:VkExternalComputeQueueNV
handles:

include::{generated}/api/handles/VkExternalComputeQueueNV.adoc[]
--

[open,refpage='vkCreateExternalComputeQueueNV',desc='Create an external compute queue for use by a compatible external API.',type='protos']
--
To create an external compute queue for use by compatible external APIs
call:

include::{generated}/api/protos/vkCreateExternalComputeQueueNV.adoc[]

  * pname:device is the VkDevice that the external queue will be a part of.
  * pname:pCreateInfo is a pointer to a
    slink:VkExternalComputeQueueCreateInfoNV structure specifying
    configuration info for creating the external queue.
  * pname:pAllocator controls host memory allocation as described in the
    <<memory-allocation, Memory Allocation>> chapter.
  * pname:pExternalQueue is a pointer to a slink:VkExternalComputeQueueNV
    object that will be filled with the handle for the created external
    queue.

include::{generated}/validity/protos/vkCreateExternalComputeQueueNV.adoc[]
--

[open,refpage='vkDestroyExternalComputeQueueNV',desc='Destroys an external queue.',type='protos']
--
To destroy a previously created external compute queue call:

include::{generated}/api/protos/vkDestroyExternalComputeQueueNV.adoc[]

  * pname:device is the logical device that destroys the external queue.
  * pname:externalQueue is the slink:VkExternalComputeQueueNV to destroy.
  * pname:pAllocator controls host memory allocation as described in the
    <<memory-allocation, Memory Allocation>> chapter.

include::{generated}/validity/protos/vkDestroyExternalComputeQueueNV.adoc[]
--

[open,refpage='vkGetExternalComputeQueueDataNV',desc='Retrieves data necessary for compatible external API initialization',type='protos']
--
To query the implementation-specific data that must be passed to compatible
external APIs during their initialization process call:

include::{generated}/api/protos/vkGetExternalComputeQueueDataNV.adoc[]

  * pname:externalQueue is the slink:VkExternalComputeQueueNV to query the
    data for.
  * pname:params is a pointer to a slink:VkExternalComputeQueueDataParamsNV
    structure specifying parameters required for retrieval of the
    implementation-specific data.
  * pname:pData is a pointer to application-allocated memory in which the
    requested data will be returned.

.Valid Usage
****
  * [[VUID-vkGetExternalComputeQueueDataNV-pData-08134]]
    pname:pData must: be at least the size specified by the externalDataSize
    field in the slink:VkPhysicalDeviceExternalComputeQueuePropertiesNV
    structure.

The sname:VkExternalComputeQueueDeviceCreateInfoNV structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/VkExternalComputeQueueDeviceCreateInfoNV.adoc[]

  * pname:sType is a elink:VkStructureType value identifying this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
    structure.
  * pname:reservedExternalQueues is the maximum number of external queues an
  application can: create at once.
  This must: be less than or equal to the pname:maxExternalQueues value
  reported by slink:VkPhysicalDeviceExternalComputeQueuePropertiesNV

The sname:VkExternalComputeQueueCreateInfoNV structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/VkExternalComputeQueueCreateInfoNV.adoc[]

  * pname:sType is a elink:VkStructureType value identifying this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
    structure.
  * pname:preferredQueue is a sname:VkQueue supporting graphics commands.

When creating a sname:VkExternalComputeQueueNV, the pname:preferredQueue
field is a strong scheduling hint as to which sname:VkQueue Vulkan graphics
workloads will be submitted to with the expectation that execution will
overlap with execution of work submitted by the external API.

  * pname:sType is a elink:VkStructureType value identifying this structure.

  * pname:deviceIndex is the index of the device within a device group that
    the data is being queried for.
    This is ignored if device groups are not utilized.
