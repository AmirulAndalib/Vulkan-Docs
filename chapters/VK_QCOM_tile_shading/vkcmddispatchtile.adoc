:refpage: vkCmdDispatchTileQCOM

To record an area-based dispatch, call:

include::{generated}/api/protos/vkCmdDispatchTileQCOM.adoc[]

  * pname:commandBuffer is the command buffer into which the command will be
    recorded.
  * pname:pDispatchTileInfo is a pointer to a slink:VkDispatchTileInfoQCOM
    structure containing information about the area-based dispatch.

This command operates in the <<renderpass-per-tile-execution-model,per-tile
execution model>>, invoking a separate dispatch for each _covered tile_.
The global workgroup count and local workgroup size of each dispatch are
defined by the implementation to efficiently iterate over a uniform grid of
pixel blocks within the area of its _active tile_.

Each shader invocation operates on a single pixel block and its size is
determined by the shader's tiling rate, which must: be defined by shaders
executed by this command.
The code:TileShadingRateQCOM execution mode operand defines the shader's
tiling rate.
Its pname:x and pname:y must: be a power of two and less than or equal to
the <<limits-maxTileShadingRate,maxTileShadingRate>> limit.
Its pname:z must: be less than or equal to the active tile's depth as
reported by apiext:VK_QCOM_tile_properties, and
[eq]#slink:VkTilePropertiesQCOM::pname:tileSize::pname:z %
code:TileShadingRateQCOM::pname:z# must: equal `0`.

The start location of the shader invocation's pixel block is
[eq]#vec3(code:TileOffsetQCOM, 0) + (code:GlobalInvocationId *
code:TileShadingRateQCOM)#

Shader invocations can: perform tile attachment load/store operations at any
location within the _active tile_, but the most efficient access may: be
limited to fragment locations within and local to the shader invocation's
pixel block.

The sname:VkDispatchTileInfoQCOM structure is defined as:

  * pname:sType is a elink:VkStructureType value identifying this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
    structure.
