To create a sname:VkSurfaceKHR object on Open Harmony OS platform, call:

include::{generated}/api/protos/vkCreateSurfaceOHOS.adoc[]

  * pname:instance is the instance to associate the surface with.
  * pname:pCreateInfo is a pointer to a slink:VkOHSurfaceCreateInfoOHOS
    structure containing parameters affecting the creation of the surface
    object.
  * pname:pAllocator is the allocator used for host memory allocated for the
    surface object when there is no more specific allocator available (see
    <<memory-allocation,Memory Allocation>>).
  * pname:pSurface is a pointer to a slink:VkSurfaceKHR handle in which the
    created surface object is returned.

The sname:VkOHSurfaceCreateInfoOHOS structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/VkOHSurfaceCreateInfoOHOS.adoc[]

  * pname:sType is a elink:VkStructureType value identifying this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
    structure.
  * pname:flags is reserved for future use.
  * pname:window: the pointer to a basetype:OHNativeWindow to associate the
    surface with.
